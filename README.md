# discordpyGUI
This python package gives you a GUI for your bot!
- Can send messages
- Can live message updates (duh)
- Can read message history (set at 20)





## Notes:
- There isnt a setup.py yet, so simply drag the folder to your project root, then import it in the script

- There isnt support for images or embed messages yet.

- Yes i know my code is terrible and my class and variable names are weird.

- Yes i also know that the colours in the gui r weird. they will be removed next time (darkmode support may also be added).




## Usage:
```python
import BotClient as bc
bot = bc.BotGui()
bot.run("<YOUR TOKEN>")

```


## Dependancies
- discord.py
